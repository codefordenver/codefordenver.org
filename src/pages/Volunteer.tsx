                    How do you find projects?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We source projects in a few ways. Most of our projects come our members having a
                    connection to a
                    partner that needs our help, but we also take project inquiries through email, find
                    good projects in
                    the Code for America network, and partners showing up to our project night.
                </p>
                <p style={question__css}>
                    What kind of projects do you work on?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We focus on projects that help the community in some tangible way. We work “with”
                    not “for” our
                    partners and hope to find things that are universal and can be shared through the
                    Code for America
                    brigade network.

                    Can I get involved even if I’m not a programmer or interested in programming?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Definitely. We do a lot of coding, but need problem solvers from all professions and
                    viewpoints to
                    make truly inclusive, community focused solutions. We have volunteers with
                    backgrounds in design,
                    marketing, sales, organizing, nonprofits, and project management. All of it is
                    valued and useful for
                    our mission.

                    Can I get involved if I’m a beginner programmer or still in school?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes! We pride ourselves on being an inclusive community that will help people apply
                    the skills they
                    are learning. Our members have a wide range of experience levels and we love to
                    welcome in new
                    coders.

                <p>
                    There are a bunch of resources to chose from, including online free and paid courses
                    and schools or
                    programs in the Denver area. We like to recommend some of the learn-to-code meetups
                    in Denver too,
                    especially the ones hosted by the Denver Public Library.

                <p>
                    We are a local chapter of Code for America, so we work closely with them. But we are
                    independent in
                    the projects we work on, with a focus on our local community.
